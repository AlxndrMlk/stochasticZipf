# Zipf's distribution from stochastic process

A Python 3 replication of Zipf's Law slope generated using stochastic process based on Suzuki et al., 2005.

  **Zipf's Law** states that *"given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table"* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)

## Some history

  **Zipf's Law** became famous when **Brenda McCowan** (McCowan et al., 1999) and her team applied it to study bottlenose **dolphin communication** and to compare it to humans.
  
### Dolphins and extraterrestrial intelligence

 From then on a debate started if and how **Zipf's Law** can be useful in context of discovering underlying structure of unknown communication systems. The law has been used not only to study **dolphins** but also in search for **extraterrestrial intelligence** (https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/animal-communication-information-theory-and-seti)

### The debate continues

Some authors propose that *"Zipf's law is required by symbolic systems"* or even that it is *"a hallmark of symbolic reference and not a meaningless feature"* (Cancho & Solé, 2003). Others argue that *"even a simple stochastic mechanism, such as a die-rolling trial, satisfies Zipf's law"* (Suzuki et al., 2005).

This notebook replicates the procedure (Die-rolling example) form Suzuki et al. (2005).

Although stochastic process can produce **Zipf's slope**, it seems that **Zipf's Law** still can be useful in diferential context (i.e. communication system development) - check McCowan et al., 2005 for details.
