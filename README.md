# Zipf's distribution from stochastic process

A Python 3 replication of Zipf's Law slope generated using stochastic process

**Zipf's Law** states that *"given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table"* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)

## Some history

**Zipf's Law** became famous when **Brenda McCowan** (McCowan et al., 1999) and her team applied it to study bottlenose **dolphin communication** and to compare it to humans.

Some authors propose that *"Zipf's law is required by symbolic systems"* or even that it is *"a hallmark of symbolic reference and not a meaningless feature"* (Cancho & Sol√©, 2003). Others argue that *"even a simple stochastic mechanism, such as a die-rolling trial, satisfies Zipf's law"* (Suzuki et al., 2005).

This notebook replicates the procedure (Die-rolling example) form Suzuki et al. (2005).
